1) 	First the Rician noise is added to the ground truth by using "addNoise.m".
		noisy = addNoise(groundTruth, standardDeviation);
		%	groundTruth: source image.
		%	standardDeviation: std deviation of noise.
		
		Eg: noisy = addNoise(image, 15);
		
2) 	Next, the vector containing the set of non local neighbours for 
	each and every voxel in the noisy image is computed through "NLMLgpu.m".
		gpuArray = NLMLgpu( noisy, searchWinDim, localWinDim);
		% noisy: noisy image
		% searchWinDim: search window dimensions 
		% localWinDim: local window dimensions
		
		Eg: gpuArray = NLMLgpu(noisy, 20, 3);
				searchWinDim: 20x20x20
				localWinDim: 3x3x3
		
		
3) 	Denoised image is generated through "NLMLbuild.m".
		denoised= NLMLbuild(noisy, gpuArray);
		
		% gpuArray is the vector containing the non local neighbours for every noisy image voxel
